With -O2, compilation takes forever.

We found the following two minimal sets of compilation flags that mitigate this blowup and make compilation manageable:

1: -fno-cse -fno-full-laziness
2: -fno-specialize -funfolding-creation-threshold=0

If disable everything except CSE and specialise, blow-up still occurs. Remains true with -O1
